A Whisper in the Woods

Chapter 1: The Lantern’s Glow

Andy Chen tightened his HKU scarf against the evening chill. As a first-year Chemistry student, he normally spent evenings in the library or gaming with friends. Tonight was different. Campus whispers had drawn him to Lung Fu Shan’s shadowy trails. Upperclassmen spoke of strange sounds in these woods—a melodic hum that seemed to call to listeners.

His lantern swung gently, casting dancing shadows between ancient banyan trees. The city’s distant glow should have made this feel safe, but the forest had its own rules. Brittle leaves crackled beneath his boots, each step taking him further from campus normality.

"Probably just wind through bamboo," he muttered to himself. Yet his scientific curiosity kept him moving forward. If there was a natural explanation, he wanted to find it.

The hum began so softly he almost missed it. A gentle vibration in the air that had nothing to do with Hong Kong’s ever-present urban murmur. It grew clearer as he walked, reminding him of temple bells heard from a distance. His pulse quickened despite himself.

The melody led him off the main path. Thick roots threatened to trip him, but the sound grew stronger, pulling him toward a small clearing. There stood the oldest banyan he’d ever seen, its aerial roots forming a wooden curtain around the trunk.

At the tree’s base rested a smooth stone about the size of his textbook. It glowed with a soft blue light that pulsed in time with the humming. As he approached, the sound stopped abruptly.

Andy knelt, setting his lantern beside him. The stone’s surface felt warm despite the cool evening. He ran his fingers over its unusual smoothness—unlike any natural rock formation he’d studied.

"Chenyou."

The voice came from everywhere and nowhere. Andy snatched his hand back, scanning the empty clearing.

"You’ve found me." The voice carried neither threat nor welcome, only simple statement. "Will you guard my secret?"

Andy’s scientific mind raced through possibilities. Audio hallucination? Some elaborate prank? But the stone’s glow pulsed steadily, and the voice had known his proper name—one only his professors and family used.

The forest waited silently. Even the usual nighttime creatures had gone quiet. Andy understood this moment mattered. His analytical nature warred with something deeper, something that recognized this was beyond textbooks and logic.

Chapter 2: The Keeper’s Choice

Andy remained kneeling before the ancient tree. The glowing stone seemed to watch him, though it had no eyes. His mind, trained to analyze data and draw conclusions, struggled with this impossible situation.

"You are the heart of the mountain?" he asked the empty air.

The voice returned, clearer now. "I am what remains of this place’s spirit. Hidden when the first roads were built. Protected as the city grew around me."

Andy glanced toward the glittering high-rises of Pok Fu Lam. He understood development pressures better than most. His own father worked in construction. Hong Kong always built upward and outward, leaving little room for mystery.

"What happens if I tell people?" he asked.

"The wrong hands would use my energy. The right hands would study me to death. Neither serves the mountain’s balance."

Andy thought of his chemistry lab. He’d watched professors dissect fascinating phenomena until nothing magical remained. Everything became data points and equations. Would this voice suffer the same fate?

He imagined campus reaction. Professors would call it a geological oddity. Students would make videos for social media. Tour companies would create "magical rock" tours. The peace of this clearing would vanish forever.

The stone’s glow intensified. "You must choose now, keeper."

Andy remembered his environmental science professor’s words: "Not everything that can be studied should be exploited." This felt like what she meant.

His gaming experience kicked in. Sometimes you protected valuable things not because you understood them, but because they mattered. The right choice wasn’t always the obvious one.

"I’ll keep your secret," he said, the words feeling both heavy and right.

The stone flared brilliantly, light washing through the clearing. Then it faded, sinking into the earth as if made of water. The ground showed no sign it had ever been there.

The forest came alive again. Leaves rustled in approval. The distant city sounds returned to normal volume. Andy felt both relief and loss.

As he walked back toward campus, he realized something had changed. He checked his phone—barely any time had passed. Yet he felt different. The mountain’s secret was his to protect now.

He looked back at the dark forest. A soft hum followed him, not in his ears but in his bones. Andy smiled. Some truths were too important for laboratory testing.
